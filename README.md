#Download only the portions you want from the YouTube videos you love

Clone this repository and run the `trimyo.sh` script. It is recommended you run this script with root privileges, as packets might need to be installed, if not available. You'll only need to insert the URL of the YouTube video you want to trim and specify the interval time of the portion you'd like to download locally; also, choose a name for the downloaded video, including the extension of the video (e.g.: `myTrimmedVideo.mp4` or `myTrimmedVideo.mkv` etc.)
